2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Changes may work on one platform but not another
   - Mitigation: Test on both platforms after each change
   
3. **Performance Impact**: Style changes may affect performance
   - Mitigation: Monitor performance metrics throughout implementation
   
4. **User Experience Disruption**: Changes may confuse existing users
   - Mitigation: Maintain functional consistency while improving visual consistency

## Resources Required

### Development Team:
- 1 Senior iOS/macOS Developer
- 1 UI/UX Designer for validation
- 1 QA Engineer for testing

### Tools and Equipment:
- Xcode development environment
- iOS and macOS test devices
- Design system validation tools
- Performance monitoring tools

### Timeline:
- Total duration: 4 weeks
- Daily standups and progress reviews
- Weekly milestone reviews
